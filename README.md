No unit tests unfortunately as I've never had the pleasure of writing one before. I'm eager to learn of course.

Please open web.html.

Kinda a mess, but thank you for the opportunity. I went the vanilla route for everything as opposed to Spring Boot APIs and Angular front end because that's the vibe I was getting from the assessment break down. I hope this wasn't to my detriment. Anyway, I've learnt a lot as I've never written anything that looks like this.

Thanks again and hope to hear from you!
